    <h2 align="center">WHY IS E-WASTE A GROWING CONCERN?</h2>
    <p>


    The unethical actions in which individuals partake often influences their surroundings , same goes for industrial bodies. As industries grow , more and more resources are required , and certain outputs are being delivered , such as products and goods .
    The certain equipment and tools used to produce the products do need maintenance , hence most businesses dispose these tools in order to purchase new equipment.
    Same goes for individuals as they may be influenced by a certain standard of living within a society , this is at a disadvantage as they could be persuaded onto buying new electronic equipment , which would potentially lead them to disposing their old ones.

           <p class="caption">Figure: Screenshot showcasing e-waste data and recycling statistics.</p> <p>The graph analysis provides information based  of the participant’s opinions on whether electronic devices can be recycled and again , these participants do seem educated , hence ,over 10 participants agreed to the question. In overall conclusion , it seems as if the majority of individuals that participated do contain a positive educational background. 
           Although 4 individuals were uncertain on the whether electronic devices can be recycled, they too seem to withhold well-balanced intellectuals.

    <p>The data above depicts the amount  of opinions received from the participants. Only a lump sum amount of about 14% of the participants chose the “Yes” option , agreeing to the disapproval of “just” disposing electronic waste anywhere. This shows that the majority of the participants are indeed well-educated , thus possess the knowledge require in electronic waste disposals and pollution.</p>
